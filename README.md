Users may enter in their favorite League character to recieve some brief lore and a splash photo of their champion.

My page has pictures of my family and me. I also have my cute kitty cats to enjoy! I have lots of interests to choose from, but for this page, I focused on cooking. Included are my own concoctions. Contact me if you would like some more!
