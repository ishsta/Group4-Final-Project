Final Project:
In this project, your group will create a fully functional website consisting of 4 pages. This is an opportunity to apply all the skills you’ve learned throughout the course, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and version control with Git. Your website will be deployed online via GitHub Pages, allowing you to showcase your work to others.



Group Responsibilities:
Each group consists of 3-4 people.

Each member should take responsibility for one of the pages, excluding the Home Page and stylesheet.
The Home Page and stylesheet should be a collaborative effort within the group, to add cohesion through your entire site.
Each group will work from 1 repository - avoid merge conflicts!
Each member should use their own API key for their page
Each student must contribute fairly - we will be reviewing the commit history


The bolded group member is your group leader for this project. They are responsible for making the repo you will be working in. All groups are fixed and cannot be changed.

Images and Links: Add ways to engage with users utilizing images and links. Images must be responsive.
Responsive design: The page should look good on both desktop and mobile devices.
Wireframes and Designs
Use a tool like Draw.io, Canva, or another design software to create a wireframe for each page.
The wireframe should outline the layout, key elements, and basic design.
Deployment
Push your project to a GitHub repository.
Deploy your website using GitHub Pages.
Include the live website link in the GitHub repository's README file.
Submission Requirements
Deployed Site
Submit a PDF document to Blackboard:
A link to the live deployed site.
A link to the repo
What the project is about and the purpose of the website.
Who your team members are
What did your team members contribute

Images of the WireFrame and Designs below on page.
README File on Github Repo:
A link to the live deployed site.
A short description of your project (two paragraphs):
What the project is about and the purpose of the website.
A description of each page, including:
Its function.
The form’s purpose and expected input/output.
How the API call works and what data it retrieves.
What animations and CSS styles are included.
